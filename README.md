# MD-Replacer (Muse Dash Skin Replacer)

**MD-Replacer** is a lightweight [MelonLoader](https://melonwiki.xyz/) mod for **Muse Dash** that allows you to replace any in-game texture (skins, UI, backgrounds, etc.) with your own custom `.png` files.

## 🚀 Features
- **Dynamic Loading:** Automatically creates the `MDRImages` folder on the first run.
- **Memory Efficient:** Uses a texture cache for performance.
- **Auto-Correction:** Resets texture scales and offsets to ensure custom skins look correct.
